                <p>
                    As a fifth-year computer engineering student with great passion for software development and the ability to pick up things quickly, I am extremely interested in 
                    working as a Software Engineer or Data Engineer. I believe my technical and soft skills developed from my education and past work experience will make me an 
                    excellent candidate for this vacancy.<br>
                    <br>
                    I am skilled with Django, HTML, CSS, C#, C++, SQL, Java, and Python through different levels of computing courses and projects. As a Data Engineer Co-op at 
                    Teck Resources, I gained experience designing and testing multiple C# applications as well as data pipelines and monitoring systems (metrics, alerts & dashboard) 
                    on GCP and Azure. I also created CI-CD tool for GCP infrastructures deployment using DevOps and Terraform. Being a Junior Software Developer/Junior Project Engineer 
                    at SMA Consulting, I practiced developing a software project for risk analysis using C#, WPF and React. This project contained both user interface, and backend 
                    logic and data structure. I am also currently working on a blog posting web application using Django frame. This diverse knowledge of software development and 
                    data engineering has prepared me to be open-minded and creative to deliver a unique product.<br>
                    <br>
                    As a Software Engineer Co-op at Levelappro, I collaborated within a team of 8 software engineers to develop a program for Bank of Beijing mainly using Java and SQL. 
                    I cultivated strong problem-solving and analytical skills as well as the ability to work in a high pressure and dynamic environment both within a team and 
                    independently. In addition, through building close relationships with customers, I was able to identify their needs and communicate with my teammates to efficiently 
                    work on the project. Moreover, I was recognized as a self-motivated quick learner and helped to onboard and mentor a new colleague. I believe my education and 
                    experiences have well prepared me to excel in this position.<br>
                    <br>
                    Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to an opportunity to further discuss my suitability for this and any other software developing positions.
